        <h1>Justin Priest</h1>
        <h2>Freshman at Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p> I am a creative mind on a journey to understand both the world around me and the world within my head. I have high functioning autism and am an introverted thinker. I'm not as good at interacting with the world around me as I am navigating the worlds I create in my head. And I love to create. The possilities are endless when the only limitation is imagination.</p>
         <p>
            I love to write, read, and watch fiction, especially and most prolifically fantasy. I also love to dabble in philosophy and have written many philosophical theses and essays over the past couple years. To take my fantasy love to the next level, I play Dungeons & Dragons with my nerd friends (who aren't like normal people so I can get along with them better). And I love fantasy videogames where I can explore other people's worlds and ideas.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also love my family. I've never been the best at socializing or even reading social cues, but through the help of my family, especially my intelligent, loving mother, I've been able to study and learn social interactions to a point where I can communicate more than effectively with others. And I won't forget my dad, once an actor and speech major, as well as a part-time editor, who has helped me immensely in how to speak and how to write. He was also the one who introduced me to my love of fantasy.
